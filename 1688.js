/**
 * You are given an integer n, the number of teams in a tournament that has strange rules:

If the current number of teams is even, each team gets paired with another team. A total of n / 2 matches are played, and n / 2 teams advance to the next round.
If the current number of teams is odd, one team randomly advances in the tournament, and the rest gets paired. A total of (n - 1) / 2 matches are played, and (n - 1) / 2 + 1 teams advance to the next round.
Return the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.
